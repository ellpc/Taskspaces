# Taskspaces
Powershell script to launch a set of applications/websites/network shares/drives based on task. 
Started because I got tired of the repetetive task of clicking and opening applications, websites, management consoles etc
when I had regular tasks or projects I was working on.
You could probably set up virtual desktops for each task, but I didn't want it completely separated.
